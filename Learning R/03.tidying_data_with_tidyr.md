# Students

The first problem is when you have column headers that are values, not variable names.

```r
> students
  grade male female
1     A    1      5
2     B    5      0
3     C    5      2
4     D    5      5
5     E    7      4
```

The first column represents each of five possible grades that students could receive for a particular class. The second and third columns give the number of male and female students, respectively, that received each grade.

This dataset actually has three variables: grade, sex, and count. The first variable, grade, is already a column, so that should remain as it is. The second variable, sex, is captured by the second and third column headings. The third variable, count, is the number of students for each combination of grade and sex.

To tidy the students data, we need to have one column for each of these three variables. We'll use the `gather()` function from tidyr to accomplish this.

```r
> gather(students, sex, count, -grade)
   grade    sex count
1      A   male     1
2      B   male     5
3      C   male     5
4      D   male     5
5      E   male     7
6      A female     5
7      B female     0
8      C female     2
9      D female     5
10     E female     4
```

Each row of the data now represents exactly one observation, characterized by a unique combination of the grade and sex variables. Each of our variables (grade, sex, and count) occupies exactly one column.

It's important to understand what each argument to `gather()` means. The data argument, students, gives the name of the original dataset. The key and value arguments -- sex and count, respectively -- give the column names for our tidy dataset. The final argument, -grade, says that we want to gather all columns EXCEPT the grade column (since grade is already a proper column variable).

# Students 2

The second messy data case we'll look at is when multiple variables are stored in one column.

```r
> students2
  grade male_1 female_1 male_2 female_2
1     A      3        4      3        4
2     B      6        4      3        5
3     C      7        4      3        8
4     D      4        0      8        1
5     E      1        1      2        7
```

This dataset is similar to the first, except now there are two separate classes, 1 and 2, and we have total counts for each sex within each class. students2 suffers from the same messy data problem of having column headers that are values (male_1, female_1, etc.) and not variable names (sex, class, and count). However, it also has multiple variables stored in each column (sex and class), which is another common symptom of messy data. Tidying this dataset will be a two step process.

Let's start by using gather() to stack the columns of students2, like we just did with students. This time, name the 'key' column sex_class and the 'value' column count. Save the result to a new variable called res.

```r
res <- gather(students2, sex_class, count, -grade)

   grade sex_class count
1      A    male_1     3
2      B    male_1     6
3      C    male_1     7
4      D    male_1     4
5      E    male_1     1
6      A  female_1     4
7      B  female_1     4
8      C  female_1     4
9      D  female_1     0
10     E  female_1     1
11     A    male_2     3
12     B    male_2     3
13     C    male_2     3
14     D    male_2     8
15     E    male_2     2
16     A  female_2     4
17     B  female_2     5
18     C  female_2     8
19     D  female_2     1
20     E  female_2     7
```

That got us half way to tidy data, but we still have two different variables, sex and class, stored together in the sex_class column. tidyr offers a convenient `separate()` function for the purpose of separating one column into multiple columns.

Call `separate()` on res to split the sex_class column into sex and class. You only need to specify the first three arguments: data = res, col = sex_class, into = c("sex", "class"). You don't have to provide the argument names as long as they are in the correct order.

```r
> separate(data = res, col = sex_class, into = c("sex", "class"))
   grade    sex class count
1      A   male     1     3
2      B   male     1     6
3      C   male     1     7
4      D   male     1     4
5      E   male     1     1
6      A female     1     4
7      B female     1     4
8      C female     1     4
9      D female     1     0
10     E female     1     1
11     A   male     2     3
12     B   male     2     3
13     C   male     2     3
14     D   male     2     8
15     E   male     2     2
16     A female     2     4
17     B female     2     5
18     C female     2     8
19     D female     2     1
20     E female     2     7
```

`separate()` was able to figure out on its own how to separate the sex_class column. Unless you request otherwise with the 'sep' argument, it splits on non-alphanumeric values. In other words, it assumes that the values are separated by something other than a letter or number (in this case, an underscore.)

Tidying students2 required both `gather()` and `separate()`, causing us to save an intermediate result (res). However, just like with dplyr, you can use the `%>%` operator to chain multiple function calls together.

```r
# Repeat your calls to gather() and separate(), but this time
# use the %>% operator to chain the commands together without
# storing an intermediate result.
#
# If this is your first time seeing the %>% operator, check
# out ?chain, which will bring up the relevant documentation.
# You can also look at the Examples section at the bottom
# of ?gather and ?separate.
#
# The main idea is that the result to the left of %>%
# takes the place of the first argument of the function to
# the right. Therefore, you OMIT THE FIRST ARGUMENT to each
# function.
#
students2 %>%
gather(sex_class, count, -grade) %>%
separate(col=sex_class, into=c("sex", "class")) %>%
print

# Students 3

A third symptom of messy data is when variables are stored in both rows and columns.

```r

```

In students3, we have midterm and final exam grades for five students, each of whom were enrolled in exactly two of five possible classes.

The first variable, name, is already a column and should remain as it is. The headers of the last five columns, class1 through class5, are all different values of what should be a class variable. The values in the test column, midterm and final, should each be its own variable containing the respective grades for each student.

```r
# Call gather() to gather the columns class1 through
# through class5 into a new variable called class.
# The 'key' should be class, and the 'value'
# should be grade.
#
# tidyr makes it easy to reference multiple adjacent
# columns with class1:class5, just like with sequences
# of numbers.
#
# Since each student is only enrolled in two of
# the five possible classes, there are lots of missing
# values (i.e. NAs). Use the argument na.rm = TRUE
# to omit these values from the final result.
#
# Remember that when you're using the %>% operator,
# the value to the left of it gets inserted as the
# first argument to the function on the right.
#
# Consult ?gather and/or ?chain if you get stuck.

# Students 4

The fourth messy data problem we'll look at occurs when multiple observational units are stored in the same table.

```r
> students4
    id  name sex class midterm final
1  168 Brian   F     1       B     B
2  168 Brian   F     5       A     C
3  588 Sally   M     1       A     C
4  588 Sally   M     3       B     C
5  710  Jeff   M     2       D     E
6  710  Jeff   M     4       A     C
7  731 Roger   F     2       C     A
8  731 Roger   F     5       B     A
9  908 Karen   M     3       C     C
10 908 Karen   M     4       A     A
```

students4 is almost the same as our tidy version of students3. The only difference is that students4 provides a unique id for each student, as well as his or her sex (M = male; F = female).

At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much of a problem with students4. All columns are variables and all rows are observations. However, notice that each id, name, and sex is repeated twice, which seems quite redundant. This is a hint that our data contains multiple observational units in a single table.

Our solution will be to break students4 into two separate tables -- one containing basic student information (id, name, and sex) and the other containing grades (id, class, midterm, final).

```r
# Complete the chained command below so that we are
# selecting the id, name, and sex column from students4
# and storing the result in student_info.
#
student_info <- students4 %>%
select(id, name, sex) %>%
print

###############################

    id  name sex
1  168 Brian   F
2  168 Brian   F
3  588 Sally   M
4  588 Sally   M
5  710  Jeff   M
6  710  Jeff   M
7  731 Roger   F
8  731 Roger   F
9  908 Karen   M
10 908 Karen   M
```

```r
# Add a call to unique() below, which will remove
# duplicate rows from student_info.
#
# Like with the call to the print() function below,
# you can omit the parentheses after the function name.
# This is a nice feature of %>% that applies when
# there are no additional arguments to specify.
#
student_info <- students4 %>%
select(id, name, sex) %>%
unique() %>%
print

###############################

   id  name sex
1 168 Brian   F
3 588 Sally   M
5 710  Jeff   M
7 731 Roger   F
9 908 Karen   M
```

```r
# select() the id, class, midterm, and final columns
# (in that order) and store the result in gradebook.
#
gradebook <- students4 %>%
select(id, class, midterm, final) %>%
print

###############################

    id class midterm final
1  168     1       B     B
2  168     5       A     C
3  588     1       A     C
4  588     3       B     C
5  710     2       D     E
6  710     4       A     C
7  731     2       C     A
8  731     5       B     A
9  908     3       C     C
10 908     4       A     A
```

It's important to note that we left the id column in both tables. In the world of relational databases, 'id' is called our 'primary key' since it allows us to connect each student listed in student_info with their grades listed in gradebook. Without a unique identifier, we might not know how the tables are related. (In this case, we could have also used the name variable, since each student happens to have a unique name.)

# Passed Failed

The fifth and final messy data scenario that we'll address is when a single observational unit is stored in multiple tables. It's the opposite of the fourth problem.

```r
> passed
   name class final
1 Brian     1     B
2 Roger     2     A
3 Roger     5     A
4 Karen     4     A

> failed
   name class final
1 Brian     5     C
2 Sally     1     C
3 Sally     3     C
4  Jeff     2     E
5  Jeff     4     C
6 Karen     3     C
```

Teachers decided to only take into consideration final exam grades in determining whether students passed or failed each class. As you may have inferred from the data, students passed a class if they received a final exam grade of A or B and failed otherwise.

The name of each dataset actually represents the value of a new variable that we will call 'status'. Before joining the two tables together, we'll add a new column to each containing this information so that its not lost when we put everything together.

Use dplyr's `mutate()` to add a new column to the passed table. The column should be called status and the value, "passed" (a character string), should be the same for all students. 'Overwrite' the current version of passed with the new one.

```r
> passed <- mutate(passed, status="passed")
   name class final status
1 Brian     1     B passed
2 Roger     2     A passed
3 Roger     5     A passed
4 Karen     4     A passed

> failed <- mutate(failed, status="failed")
   name class final status
1 Brian     5     C failed
2 Sally     1     C failed
3 Sally     3     C failed
4  Jeff     2     E failed
5  Jeff     4     C failed
6 Karen     3     C failed
```

Now, pass as arguments the passed and failed tables (in order) to the dplyr function `rbind_list()` (for 'row bind'), which will join them together into a single unit.

```r
> rbind_list(passed, failed)
Source: local data frame [10 x 4]

    name class final status
1  Brian     1     B passed
2  Roger     2     A passed
3  Roger     5     A passed
4  Karen     4     A passed
5  Brian     5     C failed
6  Sally     1     C failed
7  Sally     3     C failed
8   Jeff     2     E failed
9   Jeff     4     C failed
10 Karen     3     C failed
```

Of course, we could arrange the rows however we wish at this point, but the important thing is that each row is an observation, each column is a variable, and the table contains a single observational unit. Thus, the data are tidy.

# SAT

The SAT is a popular college-readiness exam in the United States that consists of three sections: critical reading, mathematics, and writing. Students can earn up to 800 points on each section. This dataset presents the total number of students, for each combination of exam section and sex, within each of six score ranges. It comes from the 'Total Group Report 2013', which can be found here:  http://research.collegeboard.org/programs/sat/data/cb-seniors-2013
