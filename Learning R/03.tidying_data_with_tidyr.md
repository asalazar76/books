# Students

The first problem is when you have column headers that are values, not variable names.

```r
> students
  grade male female
1     A    1      5
2     B    5      0
3     C    5      2
4     D    5      5
5     E    7      4
```

The first column represents each of five possible grades that students could receive for a particular class. The second and third columns give the number of male and female students, respectively, that received each grade.

This dataset actually has three variables: grade, sex, and count. The first variable, grade, is already a column, so that should remain as it is. The second variable, sex, is captured by the second and third column headings. The third variable, count, is the number of students for each combination of grade and sex.

To tidy the students data, we need to have one column for each of these three variables. We'll use the `gather()` function from tidyr to accomplish this.

```r
> gather(students, sex, count, -grade)
   grade    sex count
1      A   male     1
2      B   male     5
3      C   male     5
4      D   male     5
5      E   male     7
6      A female     5
7      B female     0
8      C female     2
9      D female     5
10     E female     4
```

Each row of the data now represents exactly one observation, characterized by a unique combination of the grade and sex variables. Each of our variables (grade, sex, and count) occupies exactly one column.

It's important to understand what each argument to `gather()` means. The data argument, students, gives the name of the original dataset. The key and value arguments -- sex and count, respectively -- give the column names for our tidy dataset. The final argument, -grade, says that we want to gather all columns EXCEPT the grade column (since grade is already a proper column variable).

# Students 2

The second messy data case we'll look at is when multiple variables are stored in one column.

```r
> students2
  grade male_1 female_1 male_2 female_2
1     A      3        4      3        4
2     B      6        4      3        5
3     C      7        4      3        8
4     D      4        0      8        1
5     E      1        1      2        7
```

This dataset is similar to the first, except now there are two separate classes, 1 and 2, and we have total counts for each sex within each class. students2 suffers from the same messy data problem of having column headers that are values (male_1, female_1, etc.) and not variable names (sex, class, and count). However, it also has multiple variables stored in each column (sex and class), which is another common symptom of messy data. Tidying this dataset will be a two step process.

Let's start by using gather() to stack the columns of students2, like we just did with students. This time, name the 'key' column sex_class and the 'value' column count. Save the result to a new variable called res.

```r
res <- gather(students2, sex_class, count, -grade)

   grade sex_class count
1      A    male_1     3
2      B    male_1     6
3      C    male_1     7
4      D    male_1     4
5      E    male_1     1
6      A  female_1     4
7      B  female_1     4
8      C  female_1     4
9      D  female_1     0
10     E  female_1     1
11     A    male_2     3
12     B    male_2     3
13     C    male_2     3
14     D    male_2     8
15     E    male_2     2
16     A  female_2     4
17     B  female_2     5
18     C  female_2     8
19     D  female_2     1
20     E  female_2     7
```

That got us half way to tidy data, but we still have two different variables, sex and class, stored together in the sex_class column. tidyr offers a convenient `separate()` function for the purpose of separating one column into multiple columns.

Call `separate()` on res to split the sex_class column into sex and class. You only need to specify the first three arguments: data = res, col = sex_class, into = c("sex", "class"). You don't have to provide the argument names as long as they are in the correct order.

```r
> separate(data = res, col = sex_class, into = c("sex", "class"))
   grade    sex class count
1      A   male     1     3
2      B   male     1     6
3      C   male     1     7
4      D   male     1     4
5      E   male     1     1
6      A female     1     4
7      B female     1     4
8      C female     1     4
9      D female     1     0
10     E female     1     1
11     A   male     2     3
12     B   male     2     3
13     C   male     2     3
14     D   male     2     8
15     E   male     2     2
16     A female     2     4
17     B female     2     5
18     C female     2     8
19     D female     2     1
20     E female     2     7
```

`separate()` was able to figure out on its own how to separate the sex_class column. Unless you request otherwise with the 'sep' argument, it splits on non-alphanumeric values. In other words, it assumes that the values are separated by something other than a letter or number (in this case, an underscore.)

Tidying students2 required both `gather()` and `separate()`, causing us to save an intermediate result (res). However, just like with dplyr, you can use the `%>%` operator to chain multiple function calls together.

```r
# Repeat your calls to gather() and separate(), but this time
# use the %>% operator to chain the commands together without
# storing an intermediate result.
#
# If this is your first time seeing the %>% operator, check
# out ?chain, which will bring up the relevant documentation.
# You can also look at the Examples section at the bottom
# of ?gather and ?separate.
#
# The main idea is that the result to the left of %>%
# takes the place of the first argument of the function to
# the right. Therefore, you OMIT THE FIRST ARGUMENT to each
# function.
#
students2 %>%
gather(sex_class, count, -grade) %>%
separate(col=sex_class, into=c("sex", "class")) %>%
print

# Students 3

A third symptom of messy data is when variables are stored in both rows and columns.

```r
> students3
    name    test class1 class2 class3 class4 class5
1  Sally midterm      A   <NA>      B   <NA>   <NA>
2  Sally   final      C   <NA>      C   <NA>   <NA>

4   Jeff   final   <NA>      E   <NA>      C   <NA>
5  Roger midterm   <NA>      C   <NA>   <NA>      B
6  Roger   final   <NA>      A   <NA>   <NA>      A
7  Karen midterm   <NA>   <NA>      C      A   <NA>
8  Karen   final   <NA>   <NA>      C      A   <NA>
9  Brian midterm      B   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>      A
10 Brian   final      B   <NA>   <NA>   <NA>      C
```

In students3, we have midterm and final exam grades for five students, each of whom were enrolled in exactly two of five possible classes.

The first variable, name, is already a column and should remain as it is. The headers of the last five columns, class1 through class5, are all different values of what should be a class variable. The values in the test column, midterm and final, should each be its own variable containing the respective grades for each student.

```r
# Call gather() to gather the columns class1 through
# through class5 into a new variable called class.
# The 'key' should be class, and the 'value'
# should be grade.
#
# tidyr makes it easy to reference multiple adjacent
# columns with class1:class5, just like with sequences
# of numbers.
#
# Since each student is only enrolled in two of
# the five possible classes, there are lots of missing
# values (i.e. NAs). Use the argument na.rm = TRUE
# to omit these values from the final result.
#
# Remember that when you're using the %>% operator,
# the value to the left of it gets inserted as the
# first argument to the function on the right.
#
# Consult ?gather and/or ?chain if you get stuck.

# Students 4

The fourth messy data problem we'll look at occurs when multiple observational units are stored in the same table.

```r
> students4
    id  name sex class midterm final
1  168 Brian   F     1       B     B
2  168 Brian   F     5       A     C
3  588 Sally   M     1       A     C
4  588 Sally   M     3       B     C
5  710  Jeff   M     2       D     E
6  710  Jeff   M     4       A     C
7  731 Roger   F     2       C     A
8  731 Roger   F     5       B     A
9  908 Karen   M     3       C     C
10 908 Karen   M     4       A     A
```

students4 is almost the same as our tidy version of students3. The only difference is that students4 provides a unique id for each student, as well as his or her sex (M = male; F = female).

At first glance, there doesn't seem to be much of a problem with students4. All columns are variables and all rows are observations. However, notice that each id, name, and sex is repeated twice, which seems quite redundant. This is a hint that our data contains multiple observational units in a single table.
