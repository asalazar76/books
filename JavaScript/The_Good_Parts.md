# Objects

* The simple types of JavaScript are numbers, strings, booleans ( true and false ), null, and undefined
* All other values are objects
* Numbers, strings, and booleans are object-like in that they have methods, but they are immutable
* Objects in JavaScript are mutable keyed collections
* In JavaScript, arrays are objects, functions are objects, regular expressions are objects, and, of course, objects are objects.

## Object Literals

* An object literal is a pair of curly braces surrounding zero or more name/value pairs.
* A property's name can be any string, including the empty string.
* Quotes around a property's name in an object literal are optional if the name would be a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word
    * required around "first-name"
    * optional around first_name
* A property's value can be obtained from any expression, including another object literal.

```js
var empty_object = { };

var stooge = {
    "first-name": "Jerome",
    "last-name": "Howard"
};

var flight = {
    airline: "Oceanic",
    number: 815,
    departure: {
        IATA: "SYD",
        time: "2004-09-22 14:55",
        city: "Sydney"
    },
    arrival: {
        IATA: "LAX",
        time: "2004-09-23 10:42",
        city: "Los Angeles"
    }
};
```

## Retrieval

* Values can be retrieved from an object by wrapping a string expression in a `[ ]` suffix
* If the string expression is a constant, and if it is a legal JavaScript name and not a reserved word, then the `.` notation can be used instead
    * The `.` notation is preferred because it is more compact and it reads better
* The `undefined` value is produced if an attempt is made to retrieve a nonexistent member

```js
stooge["first-name"]
flight.departure.IATA
```

* The `||` operator can be used to fill in default values

```js
var middle = stooge["middle-name"] || "(none)";
var status = flight.status || "unknown";
```

* Attempting to retrieve values from `undefined` will throw a `TypeError` exception. This can be guarded against with the `&&` operator

```js
flight.equipment // undefined
flight.equipment.model // throw "TypeError"
flight.equipment && flight.equipment.model // undefined
```

## Update

* A value in an object can be updated by assignment. If the property name already exists in the object, the property value is replaced
* If the object does not already have that property name, the object is augmented

## Reference

* **Objects are passed around by reference. They are never copied**

## Prototype

* Every object is linked to a prototype object from which it can inherit properties
    * All objects created from object literals are linked to `Object.prototype`, an object that comes standard with JavaScript
* When you make a new object, you can select the object that should be its prototype.
* The `create` method creates a new object that uses an old object as its prototype

```js
if (typeof Object.create !== 'function') {
    Object.create = function(o) {
        var F = function() { };
        F.prototype = o;
        return new F();
    };
}
var another_stooge = Object.create(stooge);
```

* The prototype link has no effect on updating. When we make changes to an object, the object's prototype is not touched
* The prototype link is used only in retrieval. If we try to retrieve a property value from an object, and if the object lacks the property name, then JavaScript attempts to retrieve the property value from the prototype object. And if that object is lacking the property, then it goes to its prototype, and so on until the process finally bottoms out with Object.prototype . If the desired property exists nowhere in the prototype chain, then the result is the `undefined` value
    * This is called delegation
* The prototype relationship is a dynamic relationship. If we add a new property to a prototype, that property will immediately be visible in all of the objects that are based on that prototype

## Reflection

* The `typeof` operator can be very helpful in determining the type of a property
* Some care must be taken because any property on the prototype chain can produce a value
    *  when you are reflecting, you are interested in data, and so you should be aware that some values could be functions.

```js
typeof flight.toString // 'function'
typeof flight.constructor // 'function'
```

* The other approach is to use the `hasOwnProperty` method, which returns true if the object has a particular property
    * The `hasOwnProperty` method does not look at the prototype chain

```js
flight.hasOwnProperty('number') // true
flight.hasOwnProperty('constructor') // false
```

## Enumeration

* The `for in` statement can loop over all of the property names in an object
* The enumeration will include all of the properties -- including functions and prototype properties that you might not be interested in
    *  The most common filters are the `hasOwnProperty` method and using `typeof` to exclude functions

```js
var name;
for (name in another_stooge) {
    if (typeof another_stooge[name] !== 'function') {
        document.writeln(name + ': ' + another_stooge[name]);
    }
}
```

* There is no guarantee on the order of the names
* If you want to assure that the properties appear in a particular order, it is best to avoid the for in statement entirely and instead make an array containing the names of the properties in the correct order

```js
var i;
var properties = [
    'first-name',
    'middle-name',
    'last-name',
    'profession'
];
for (i = 0; i < properties.length; i += 1) {
    document.writeln(properties[i] + ': ' + another_stooge[properties[i]]);
}
```

## Delete

* The `delete` operator can be used to remove a property from an object
    * It will remove a property from the object if it has one
    * It will not touch any of the objects in the prototype linkage

```js
delete another_stooge.nickname;
```

## Global Abatement

* JavaScript makes it easy to define global variables that can hold all of the assets of your application
* One way to minimize the use of global variables is to create a single global variable for your application
    * That variable then becomes the container for your application

```js
var MYAPP = {};

MYAPP.stooge = {
    firstName : "Joe",
    lastName: "Howard"
};

MYAPP.flight = {
    //...
};
```

# Functions

* Functions in JavaScript are objects
    * Objects are collections of name/value pairs having a hidden link to a prototype object
    * Objects produced from object literals are linked to `Object.prototype`
* Function objects are linked to `Function.prototype` (which is itself linked to `Object.prototype`)
    * Every function is also created with two additional hidden properties
        * the function's context
        * the code that implements the function's behavior.
* Every function object is also created with a `prototype` property
    * Its value is an object with a constructor property whose value is the function
    * This is distinct from the hidden link to `Function.prototype`

## Function Literal

* Function objects are created with function literals
* The function object created by a function literal contains a link to that outer context
    * This is called closure
    * This is the source of enormous expressive power

```js
var add = function(a,b) {
    return a + b;
};
```

## Invocation

* Invoking a function suspends the execution of the current function, passing control and parameters to the new function
* In addition to the declared parameters, every function receives two additional parameters
    * `this` -  determined by the invocation pattern (method invocation pattern, the function invocation pattern, the constructor invocation pattern, and the apply invocation pattern)
    * `arguments`
* There is no runtime error when the number of arguments and the number of parameters do not match
    * If there are too many argument values, the extra argument values will be ignored
    * If there are too few argument values, the undefined value will be substituted for the missing values
* There is no type checking on the argument values
    * any type of value can be passed to any parameter.

### The Method Invocation Pattern

* When a function is stored as a property of an object, we call it a method.
* When a method is invoked, `this` is bound to that object
* If an invocation expression contains a refinement (that is, a `.` dot expression or `[subscript]` expression), it is invoked as a method
* A method can use `this` to access the object so that it can retrieve values from the object or modify the object
* **The binding of `this` to the object happens at invocation time**
    * This very late binding makes functions that use `this` highly reusable
* Methods that get their object context from this are called public methods

```js
var myObject = {
    value: 0,
    increment: function(inc) {
        this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
    }
};

myObject.increment();
console.log(myObject.value); //1

myObject.increment(2);
console.log(myObject.value); //3
```

### The Function Invocation Pattern

* When a function is not the property of an object, then it is invoked as a function
* When a function is invoked with this pattern, `this` is bound to the global object

```js
var sum = add(3, 4);    // sum is 7
```

* This was a mistake in the design of the language
    * Had the language been designed correctly, when the inner function is invoked, `this` would still be bound to the `this` variable of the outer function
    * A consequence of this error is that a method cannot employ an inner function to help it do its work because the inner function does not share the methodâ€™s access to the object as its `this` is bound to the wrong value
    * workaround: define a variable and assigns it the value of `this`. then the inner function will have access to `this` through that variable. By convention, the name of that variable is `that`

```js
var myObject = {
    value: 0,
    increment: function(inc) {
        this.value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
    },
    add: function(first, second) {
        return first + second;
    }
};

myObject.double = function() {
    var that = this; //workaround

    var helper = function() {
        that.value += that.add(that.value, that.value);
    };
    helper();
};

myObject.increment();
myObject.increment(2);
myObject.double();
console.log(myObject.value);
```

### The Constructor Invocation Pattern

* JavaScript is a prototypal inheritance language. **Objects can inherit properties directly from other objects. The language is class-free.**
* If a function is invoked with the `new` prefix, then a new object will be created with a hidden link to the value of the functionâ€™s `prototype` member, and this will be bound to that new object
* Functions that are intended to be used with the new prefix are called constructors
    * By convention, they are kept in variables with a capitalized name. If a constructor is called without the new prefix, very bad things can happen without a compile-time or runtime warning, so the capitalization convention is really important.
* **Use of this style of constructor functions is not recommended.**

```js
var Quo = function (string) {
    this.status = string;
};

Quo.prototype.get_status = function () {
    return this.status;
};

var myQuo = new Quo("confused");
console.log(myQuo.get_status()); //confused
```

### The Apply Invocation Pattern

* The `apply` method lets us construct an array of arguments to use to invoke a function
    * It also lets us choose the value of `this`
* The apply method takes two parameters
    * The first is the value that should be bound to `this`
    * The second is an array of parameters

```js
var add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

var array = [3, 4];
var sum = add.apply(null, array);
console.log(sum);

//----------------------------------

var statusObject = {
    status: 'A-OK'
};

var Quo = function (string) {
    this.status = string;
};

Quo.prototype.get_status = function () {
    return this.status;
};

var status = Quo.prototype.get_status.apply(statusObject);
console.log(status);//A-OK
```

## Arguments

* the `arguments` array gives the function access to all of the arguments that were supplied with the invocation, including excess arguments that were not assigned to parameters
* Because of a design error, arguments is not really an array
    * It is an array-like object
    * `arguments` has a length property, but it lacks all of the array methods

```js
var sum = function() {
    var sum = 0;
    for (i in arguments) {
        sum += arguments[i];
    }
    return sum;
}

console.log(sum(1,2,3));
```

## Functions

* A function always returns a value. If the return value is not specified, then `undefined` is returned
* If the function was invoked with the `new` prefix and the return value is not an object, then `this` (the new object) is returned instead.

## Exceptions

* The `throw` statement interrupts execution of the function
    * It should be given an exception object containing a `name` property that identifies the type of the exception, and a descriptive `message` property
    * You can also add other properties.
* A `try` statement has a single `catch` block that will catch all exceptions. If your handling depends on the type of the exception, then the exception handler will have to inspect the name to determine the type of the exception.


```js
var add = function(a, b) {
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number') {
        throw {
            name: 'TypeError',
            message: 'add needs numbers'
        };
    }
    return a + b;
};

var try_it = function() {
    try {
        add("seven");
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e.name + ': ' + e.message);
    }
}

try_it();
```

## Augmenting Types

* adding a method to `Object.prototype` makes that method available to all objects. This also works for functions, arrays, strings, numbers, regular expressions, and booleans.
* by augmenting `Function.prototype`, we can make a method available to all functions
* By augmenting `Function.prototype` with a `method` method, we no longer have to type
the name of the prototype property.
* all values are immediately endowed with the new methods, even values that were created before the methods were created

```js
Function.prototype.method = function(name, func) {
    this.prototype[name] = func;
    return this;
};

Number.method('integer', function () {
    return Math[this < 0 ? 'ceil' : 'floor'](this);
});

console.log((-10/3).integer()); //-3

String.method('trim', function () {
    return this.replace(/^\s+|\s+$/g, '');
});

console.log('"' + " neat ".trim() + '"'); //"neat"
```

* add a method only if the method is known to be missing

```js
Function.prototype.method = function(name, func) {
    if (!this.prototype[name]) {
        this.prototype[name] = func;
    }
};
```

* the `for in` statement interacts badly with prototypes. We can mitigate that with
    * `hasOwnProperty` method to screen out inherited properties
    * and we can look for specific types


## Recursion

```js
var hanoi = function(disc, src, aux, dst) {
    if (disc > 0) {
        hanoi(disc - 1, src, dst, aux);
        console.log('Move disc ' + disc + ' from ' + src + ' to ' + dst);
        hanoi(disc - 1, aux, src, dst);
    }
};
hanoi(3, 'Src', 'Aux', 'Dst');
```

## Scope

* JavaScript does not have block scope even though its block syntax suggests that it does.
* JavaScript does have function scope. Parameters and variables defined in a function are not visible outside of the function, and variables defined anywhere within a function is visible everywhere within the function
* In many modern languages, it is recommended that variables be declared as late as possible, at the first point of use. That turns out to be bad advice for JavaScript because it lacks block scope.
    * **it is best to declare all of the variables used in a function at the top of the function body**

## Closure

* `myObject` had a value and an increment method. Suppose we wanted to protect the value from unauthorized changes.
* Instead of initializing `myObject` with an object literal, we will initialize myObject by calling a function that returns an object literal
    * That function defines a `value` variable
    * That variable is always available to the `increment` and `getValue` methods, but the functionâ€™s scope keeps it hidden from the rest of the program
* We are not assigning a function to `myObject`. We are assigning the result of invoking that function
    * Notice the `()` on the last line
    * The function returns an object containing two methods, and those methods continue to enjoy the privilege of access to the value variable

```js

var myObject = function() {
    var value = 0;
    return {
        increment: function(inc) {
            value += typeof inc === 'number' ? inc : 1;
        },
        getValue: function() {
            return value;
        }
    };
}();

myObject.increment();
myObject.increment(2);
console.log(myObject.getValue()); //3
```

* Doing the same thing with `Quo`
    * This quo function is designed to be used without the `new` prefix, so the name is not capitalized.

```js
var quo = function (status) {
    return {
        get_status: function() {
            return status;
        }
    };
};

var myQuo = quo("amazed");
console.log(myQuo.get_status()); //amazed
```

## Module

* We can use functions and closure to make modules. A module is a function or object that presents an interface but that hides its state and implementation.
* By using functions to produce modules, we can almost completely eliminate our use of global variables
* The general pattern of a module is a function that defines private variables and functions; creates privileged functions which, through closure, will have access to the private variables and functions; and that returns the privileged functions or stores them in an accessible place

### Example 1

```js
String.method('deentityify', function() {
    var entity = {
        quot: '"',
        lt: '<',
        gt: '>'
    };

    return function() {
        return this.replace(/&([^&;]+);/g,
            function(a,b) {
                var r = entity[b];
                return typeof r === 'string' ? r : a;
            }
        );
    };
}());

console.log('&lt;&quot;&gt;'.deentityify());
```

* Notice the last line. We immediately invoke the function we just made with the `( )` operator. That invocation creates and returns the function that becomes the `deentityify` method.
* The module pattern takes advantage of function scope and closure to create relation- ships that are binding and private. In this example, only the `deentityify` method has access to the entity data structure.

### Example 2

* The methods do not make use of this or that. As a result, there is no way to compromise the seqer
* It isnâ€™t possible to get or change the `prefix` or `seq` except as permitted by the methods
* The seqer object is mutable, so the methods could be replaced, but that still does not give access to its secrets
* If we passed `seqer.gensym` to a third partyâ€™s function, that function would be able to generate unique strings, but would be unable to change the `prefix` or `seq`

```js
var serial_maker = function() {
    var prefix = '';
    var seq = 0;
    return {
        set_prefix: function(p) {
            prefix = String(p);
        },
        set_seq: function(s) {
            seq = s;
        },
        gensym: function() {
            var result = prefix + seq;
            seq += 1;
            return result;
        }
    };
};
var seqer = serial_maker();
seqer.set_prefix('Q');
seqer.set_seq(1000);
console.log(seqer.gensym());
```

## Cascade

* Some methods do not have a return value
    * For example, it is typical for methods that set or change the state of an object to return nothing
* If we have those methods return `this` instead of `undefined`, we can enable cascades

```js
getElement('myBoxDiv').
    move(350, 150).
    width(100).
    height(100).
    color('red').
    border('10px outset').
    padding('4px').
    appendText("Please stand by");
```

## Curry

* Functions are values, and we can manipulate function values in interesting ways
* `Currying` allows us to produce a new function by combining a function and an argument
* The `curry` method works by creating a closure that holds that original function and the arguments to curry
    * It returns a function that, when invoked, returns the result of calling that original function, passing it all of the arguments from the invocation of curry and the current invocation
    * It uses the Array `concat` method to concatenate the two arrays of arguments together

```js
Function.method('curry', function () {
    var slice = Array.prototype.slice,
        args = slice.apply(arguments),
        that = this;
    return function () {
        return that.apply(null, args.concat(slice.apply(arguments)));
    };
});

var add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
};

var add1 = add.curry(1);
console.log(add1(6)); //7
```

## Memoization

* Functions can use objects to remember the results of previous operations, making it possible to avoid unnecessary work
    * This optimization is called *memoization*

```js
var fibonacci_recursive = function(n) {
    return n < 2 ? n : fibonacci_recursive(n-1) + fibonacci_recursive(n-2);
};

var fibonacci_memoized = function() {
    var memo = [0, 1];
    var fib = function(n) {
        var result = memo[n];
        if (typeof result !== 'number') {
            result = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2);
            memo[n] = result;
        }
        return result;
    };
    return fib;
}();
```

# Inheritance

* **JavaScript, being a loosely typed language, never casts. The lineage of an object is irrelevant. What matters about an object is what it can do, not what it is descended from.**
* JavaScript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit directly from other objects.

## Pseudoclassical

* Instead of having objects inherit directly from other objects, an unnecessary level of indirection is inserted such that objects are produced by constructor functions.
* When a function object is created, the Function constructor that produces the function object runs some code like this:

```js
this.prototype = { constructor: this };
```

* The new function object is given a `prototype` property whose value is an object containing a constructor property whose value is the new function object.
    * The `prototype` object is the place where inherited traits are to be deposited
    * Every function gets a `prototype` object because the language does not provide a way of deter- mining which functions are intended to be used as constructors.
* When a function is invoked with the constructor invocation pattern using the `new` prefix, this modifies the way in which the function is executed.
    * there is a serious hazard with the use of constructor functions. If you forget to include the `new` prefix when calling a constructor function, then `this` will not be bound to a new object
    * `this` will be bound to the global object, so instead of augmenting your new object, you will be clobbering global variables
    * To mitigate this problem, there is a convention that all constructor functions are named with an initial capital, and that nothing else is spelled with an initial capital.
    * A much better alternative is to not use `new` at all.
* Much of the complexity of class hierarchies is motivated by the constraints of static type checking. JavaScript is completely free of those constraints
    * In classical languages, class inheritance is the only form of code reuse. JavaScript has more and better options.

## Object Specifiers

* It sometimes happens that a constructor is given a very large number of parameters. This can be troublesome because it can be very difficult to remember the order of the arguments
* In such cases, it can be much friendlier if we write the constructor to accept a single object specifier instead. That object contains the specification of the object to be constructed
* instead of

```js
var myObject = maker(f, l, m, c, s);
```

* we can write

```js
var myObject = maker({
    first: f,
    last: l,
    state: s,
    city: c
});
```

* The arguments can now be listed in any order, arguments can be left out if the con- structor is smart about defaults, and the code is much easier to read

## Prototypal

* In a purely prototypal pattern, we dispense with classes. We focus instead on the objects.
* Prototypal inheritance is conceptually simpler than classical inheritance: **a new object can inherit the properties of an old object**
* By customizing a new object, we specify the differences from the object on which it is based

```js
var myMammal = {
    name: 'Herb the Mammal',
    get_name: function() {
        return this.name;
    },
    says: function() {
        return this.saying || 'not_found';
    }
};

console.log(myMammal.says());//not_found

var myCat = Object.create(myMammal);
myCat.name = 'Henrietta';
myCat.saying = 'meow';
myCat.purr = function(n) {
    var i, s = '';
    for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s) {
            s += '-';
        }
        s += 'r';
    }
    return s;
};
myCat.get_name = function() {
    return this.says() + ' ' + this.name + ' ' + this.says();
};

console.log(myCat.get_name()); //meow Henrietta meow
```

## Functional

* One weakness of the previous inheritance patterns is that we get no privacy.
* **All properties of an object are visible. We get no private variables and no private methods.**
* a much better alternative: we start by making a function that will produce objects. We will give it a name that starts with a lowercase letter because it will not require the use of the `new` prefix. The function contains four steps
    * 1. It creates a new object (an object literal, a constructor function with the `new` prefix, Object.create, or any function that returns an object)
    * 2. It optionally defines private instance variables and methods. These are just ordinary `vars` of the function
    * 3. It augments that new object with methods. Those methods will have privileged access to the parameters and the `vars` defined in the second step.
    * 4. It returns that new object.

```js
var constructor = function(spec, my) {
    var that, other_private_instance_variables;
    my = my || { };

    //Add shared variables and functions to my

    that = a_new_object;

    //Add privileged methods to that

    return that;
};
```

* The `spec` object contains all of the information that the constructor needs to make an instance
    * The contents of the `spec` could be copied into private variables or transformed by other functions
    * Or the methods can access information from `spec` as they need it.
* The `my` object is a container of secrets that are shared by the constructors in the inheritance chain
    * The use of the `my` object is optional
    * If a `my` object is not passed in, then a `my` object is made
* Declare the private instance variables and private methods for the object (done by simply declaring variables)
    * variables and inner functions of the constructor become the private members of the instance
    * inner functions have access to `spec` and `my` and `that` and the private variables
* add the shared secrets to the `my` object. This is done by assignment: `my.member = value;`
* Now, we make a new object and assign it to `that` (there are lots of ways to make a new object)
* Next, we augment `that`, adding the privileged methods that make up the objectâ€™s interface
    * We can assign new functions to members of `that`
    * more securely, we can define the functions first as private methods, and then assign them to `that`

```js
var methodical = function() {
    //...
};
that.methodical = methodical;
```

* The advantage to defining `methodical` in two steps is that if other methods want to call methodical, they can call `methodical()` instead of `that.methodical()`
    * If the instance is damaged or tampered with so that `that.methodical` is replaced, the methods that call `methodical` will continue to work the same because their private `methodical` is not affected by modification of the instance
* Finally, we return `that`
* If all of the state of an object is private, then the object is tamper-proof
    * Properties of the object can be replaced or deleted, but the integrity of the object is not compromised
    * If we create an object in the functional style, and if all of the methods of the object make no use of `this` or `that`, then the object is durable.
* A durable object cannot be compromised. Access to a durable object does not give an attacker the ability to access the internal state of the object except as permitted by the methods

```js
var mammal = function(spec) {
    var that = { };
    that.get_name = function() {
        return spec.name;
    };
    that.says = function() {
        return spec.saying || 'not_found';
    };
    return that;
};
var myMammal = mammal({name: 'Herb'});

var cat = function(spec) {
    spec.saying = spec.saying || 'meow';
    var that = mammal(spec);
    that.purr = function(n) {
        var i, s = '';
        if (s) {
            s += '-';
        }
        s += 'r';
    };
    that.get_name = function() {
        return that.says() + ' ' + spec.name + ' ' + that.says();
    };
    return that;
};
var myCat = cat({name: 'Henrietta'});

Function.prototype.method = function(name, func) {
    this.prototype[name] = func;
    return this;
};

Object.method('superior', function(name) {
    var that = this,
        method = that[name];
    return function() {
        return method.apply(that, arguments);
    };
});

var coolcat = function(spec) {
    var that = cat(spec),
        super_get_name = that.superior('get_name');
    that.get_name = function(n) {
        return 'like ' + super_get_name() + ' baby';
    };
    return that;
}

var myCoolCat = coolcat({name: 'bixby'});
console.log(myCoolCat.get_name());
```

## Parts

* We can compose objects out of sets of parts
* The "part" here is an "event processing part" embodied in the eventuality function object. You could imagine different parts that add other functions. The idea here is that you can use this system to add this functionality to individual objects where you need it. This concept is called a Mixin.

```js
var eventuality = function(that) {
    var registry = { };

    that.fire = function(event) {
        var array,
            func,
            handler,
            i,
            type = typeof event === 'string' ? event : event.type;

        if (registry.hasOwnProperty(type)) {
            array = registry[type];
            for (i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
                handler = array[i];
                console.log('fire(): handler found at loop ' + i);

                func = handler.method;
                if (typeof func === 'string') {
                    console.log('fire(): the found func is a string');
                    console.log(func);
                } else {
                    console.log('fire(): the found method is NOT a string');
                    func.apply(this, handler.parameters);
                }

            }
        }
        return this;
    };
    that.on = function(type, method, parameters) {
        var handler = {
            method: method,
            parameters: typeof parameters === 'string' ? [parameters] : parameters
        };
        if (registry.hasOwnProperty(type)) {
            registry[type].push(handler);
        } else {
            console.log('on(): "' + type + '" event registered');
            registry[type] = [handler];
        }
        return this;
    };
    return that;
}

var myVar = {
    hello: function(name) {
        console.log('hello ' + name);
    },
    message: "this is a message"
};
eventuality(myVar);

myVar.on('test', myVar.hello, 'Danilo');
myVar.fire('test');
myVar.on('message', myVar.message);
myVar.fire({type: 'message'});
```

# Arrays

* JavaScript provides an object that has some array-like characteristics
* significantly slower than a real array, but be more convenient to use
* inherits from `Array.prototype`

## Array Literals

* An array literal is a pair of square brackets surrounding zero or more values separated by commas
* JavaScript allows an array to contain any mixture of values

```js
var empty = [ ];
var numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two'];
var misc = ['string', 98.6, false, null, undefined, ['nested', 'array'], {object: true}, NaN, Infinity];
console.log(empty[1]);//undefined
console.log(numbers[1]);//one
for (var i = 0; i < misc.length; i++) {
    console.log('//' + i + ': ' + misc[i]);
}
```

## Length

* array `length` is not an upper bound
*  If you store an element with a subscript that is greater than or equal to the current `length`, the `length` will increase to contain the new element.  
    * **There is no array bounds error**
* The [] postfix subscript operator converts its expression to a string using the expressionâ€™s `toString` method if it has one. That string will be used as the property name
    * If the string looks like a positive integer that is greater than or equal to the arrayâ€™s current length and is less than 4,294,967,295, then the length of the array is set to the new subscript plus one.
* The `length` can be set explicitly
    * Making the `length` larger does not allocate more space for the array
    *  Making the `length` smaller will cause all properties with a subscript that is greater than or equal to the new `length` to be deleted
* A new element can be appended to the end of an array by assigning to the arrayâ€™s current `length`
    * sometimes it is more convenient to use the `push` method

```js
var numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'];
numbers.length = 3; //[ 'zero', 'one', 'two' ]
numbers[numbers.length] = 'tres'; //[ 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'tres' ]
numbers.push('quatro'); //[ 'zero', 'one', 'two', 'tres', 'quatro' ]
```

## Delete

* the `delete` operator can be used to remove elements from an array
    * Unfortunately, that leaves a hole in the array

```js
var numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'];
delete numbers[2]; //[ 'zero', 'one', , 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine' ]
```

* JavaScript arrays have a `splice` method
    *  The first argument is an ordinal in the array
    * The second argument is the number of elements to delete
    * Any additional arguments get inserted into the array at that point
    * **Because every property after the deleted property must be removed and reinserted with a new key, this might not go quickly for large arrays**

```js
var numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine'];
numbers.splice(2,1);
```

## Confusion

* A common error in JavaScript programs is to use an object when an array is required or an array when an object is required
* The rule is simple: **when the property names are small sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an object**
    *  The `typeof` operator reports that the type of an array is 'object'

```js
var is_array = function(value) {
    return value && // reject null and other false values
        typeof value === 'object' && // true for objects, arrays, and (weirdly) null
        typeof value.length === 'number' && // the value has a length property that is a number
        typeof value.splice === 'function' && // the value contains a splice method
        !(value.propertyIsEnumerable('length')); //the length property is enumerable (will length be produced by a for in loop?)
};
```

## Methods

* `Array.prototype` can be augmented the same way as `Object.prototype`
    * we want to add an array method that will allow us to do computation on an array
* It is not useful to use the `Object.create` method on arrays because it produces an object, not an array
    * The object produced will inherit the arrayâ€™s values and methods, but it will not have the special `length` property.

```js
Function.prototype.method = function(name, func) {
    this.prototype[name] = func;
    return this;
};

Array.method('reduce', function(f) {
    var i, value;
    for (i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
        value = f(this[i], value);
    }
    return value;
});

var add = function(a, b) {
    if (b === undefined) {
        return a;
    }
    if (a === undefined) {
        return b;
    }
    return a + b;
};

var mult = function(a, b) {
    if (b === undefined) {
        return a;
    }
    if (a === undefined) {
        return b;
    }
    return a * b;
}
var data = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42];
console.log(data.reduce(add));
console.log(data.reduce(mult));

data.sum = function() {
    return data.reduce(add);
}
console.log(data.sum());
```

## Dimensions

* JavaScript arrays usually are not initialized
* we can fix this with the following function

```js
Array.dim = function(dimension) {
    var a = [ ], i;
    for (i = 0; i < dimension; i++) {
        a[i] = 0;
    }
    return a;
}
console.log(Array.dim(10)); // [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]
```

* To make a two-dimensional array or an array of arrays, you must build the arrays yourself

```js
Array.dim = function(dimension) {
    var a = [ ], i;
    for (i = 0; i < dimension; i++) {
        a[i] = 0;
    }
    return a;
};
console.log(Array.dim(10)); // [ 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 ]

Array.matrix = function(rows, columns) {
    var m = [ ], a, i, j;
    for (i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        m[i] = [ ];
        for (j = 0; j < columns; j++) {
            m[i][j] = 0;
        }
    }
    return m;
};
console.log(Array.matrix(2, 3));// [ [ 0, 0, 0 ], [ 0, 0, 0 ] ]
```

# Regular Expressions

* JavaScriptâ€™s Regular Expression feature was borrowed from Perl
* The methods that work with regular expressions are
    * `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`
    * `string.match`, `string.replace`, `string.search`, and `string.split`
* The part of the language that is least portable is the implementation of regular expressions
    * Regular expressions that are very complicated or convoluted are more likely to have portability problems
    * Nested regular expressions can also suffer horrible performance problems in some implementations
    * Simplicity is the best strategy.

## Construction

* The preferred way to make a `RegExp` object is to use a regular expression literal.
    * Regular expression literals are enclosed in slashes
* There are three flags that can be set on a `RegExp`: `g`, `i`, and `m`
    * **g** - Global (match multiple times; the precise meaning of this varies with the method)
    * **i** - Insensitive (ignore character case)
    * **m** - Multiline (^ and $ can match line-ending characters)
* The other way to make a regular expression is to use the `RegExp` constructor. The constructor takes a string and compiles it into a `RegExp` object.
    * The second parameter is a string specifying the flags
    * The `RegExp` constructor is useful when a regular expression must be generated at runtime using material that is not available to the programmer.

```js
var parse_number = /^-?\d+(?:\.\d*)?(?:e[+\-]?\d+)?$/i;//literal
var my_regexp = new RegExp("\"(?:\\.|[^\\\\\\\"])*\"", 'g');//constructor
```

## Elements

### Regexp Choice

* A *regexp* choice contains one or more *regexp sequences*
* The sequences are separated by the | (vertical bar) character
* The choice matches if any of the sequences match
    * It attempts to match each of the sequences in order.

```js
"into".match(/in|int/)
```

### Regexp Sequence

* A *regexp sequence* contains one or more *regexp factors*
* Each factor can optionally be followed by a quantifier that determines how many times the factor is allowed to appear
    * If there is no quantifier, then the factor will be matched one time

### Regexp Factor

* A *regexp factor* can be a character, a parenthesized group, a character class, or an escape sequence
* All characters are treated literally except for the control characters and the special characters: `\ / [ ] ( ) { } ? + * | . ^ $`
    * these must be escaped with a `\` prefix if they are to be matched literally
    * any special character can be given a `\` prefix to make it literal
* An unescaped `.` matches any character except a line-ending character
* An unescaped `^` matches the beginning of the text when the `lastIndex` property is zero
    * It can also match line-ending characters when the `m` flag is specified
* An unescaped `$` matches the end of the text
    * It can also match line-ending characters when the `m` flag is specified

### Regexp Escape

* The backslash character indicates escapement in regexp factors as well as in strings, but in regexp factors, it works a little differently.
* `\d` is the same as [0-9] -- It matches a digit. `\D` is the opposite: [^0-9]
* `\s` is the same as [\f\n\r\t\u000B\u0020\u00A0\u2028\u2029] -- a partial set of Unicode whitespace characters. `\S` is the opposite: [^\f\n\r\t\u000B\u0020\u00A0\u2028\ u2029]
* `\w` is the same as [0-9A-Z_a-z]. `\W` is the opposite: [^0-9A-Z_a-z]
    * the class it defines is useless for working with virtually any real language
    * If you need to match a class of letters, you must specify your own class.
    * A simple letter class is [A-Za-z\u00C0-\u1FFF\u2800-\uFFFD]
* `\1` is a reference to the text that was captured by group `1` so that it can be matched again.
    * you could search text for duplicated words with `/[A-Za-z\u00C0-\u1FFF\u2800-\uFFFD'\-]+\s+\1/gi`

### Regexp Group

* There are four kinds of groups
* 1. **Capturing** -- A capturing group is a regexp choice wrapped in parentheses. The characters that match the group will be captured
* 2. **Noncapturing** -- A noncapturing group has a `(?:` prefix. A noncapturing group simply matches; it does not capture the matched text.
* 3. **Positive lookahead** -- A positive lookahead group has a `(?=` prefix. It is like a noncapturing group except that after the group matches, the text is rewound to where the group started, effectively matching nothing. **not a good part**
* 4. **Negative lookahead** -- A negative lookahead group has a `(?!` prefix. It is like a positive lookahead group, except that it matches only if it fails to match. **not a good part**

### Regexp Class

* a convenient way of specifying one of a set of characters
    * if we wanted to match a vowel, we could write `(?:a|e|i|o|u)`, but it is more conveniently written as the class `[aeiou]`.
* Classes provide two other conveniences
* ranges of characters can be specified: `[A-Za-z]`
* The other convenience is the complementing of a class. If the first character after the `[` is `^`, then the class excludes the specified characters

### Regexp Class Escape

* The rules of escapement within a character class are slightly different than those for a regexp factor
* `[\b]` is the backspace character
* the special characters that should be escaped in a character class: `- / [ \ ] ^`

### Regexp Quantifier

* A regexp factor may have a regexp quantifier suffix that determines how many times the factor should match
    * A number wrapped in curly braces means that the factor should match that many times
* Matching tends to be greedy, matching as many repetitions as possible up to the limit, if there is one
    * `?` is the same as {0,1}. `*` is the same as {0,}. `+` is the same as {1,}.
    * If the quantifier has an extra `?` suffix, then matching tends to be lazy, attempting to match as few repetitions as possible
    * It is usually best to stick with the greedy matching

# Methods

## Array

* `array.concat(item...)` -- produces a new array containing a **shallow** copy of this array with the items appended to it. If an item is an array, then each of its elements is appended individually
* `array.join(separator)` -- makes a string from an array. It does this by making a string of each of the arrayâ€™s elements, and then concatenating them all together with a separator between them. The default separator is `,`.
* `array.pop()` -- makes  an array work like a stack; the pop method removes and
returns the last element in this array. If the array is empty, it returns undefined
* `array.push(item...)` -- appends items to the end of an array. It modifies the array and appends array items whole; it returns the new length of the array
* `array.reverse()` -- modifies the array by reversing the order of the elements. It returns the array
* `array.shift()` -- removes the first element from an array and returns it. If the array is empty, it returns `undefined`; usually much slower than `pop`
* `array.slice(start, end)` -- makes a shallow copy of a portion of an array. The first element copied will be `array[start]`. It will stop before copying `array[end]`. The end parameter is optional, and the default is `array.length`.
* `array.sort(comparefn)` -- JavaScriptâ€™s default comparison function assumes that the elements to be sorted are strings. It converts the numbers to strings as it compares them, ensuring a shockingly incorrect result.
    * Your comparison function should take two parameters and return 0 if the two parameters are equal, a negative number if the first parameter should come first, and a positive number if the second parameter should come first.
    * [07_methods/array_sort_example.js](the_good_parts_code/07_methods/array_sort_example.js)
* `array.splice(start, deleteCount, item...)` -- removes elements from an array, replacing them with new items.
    * The start parameter is the number of a position within the array.
    * The deleteCount parameter is the number of elements to delete starting from that position
    * If there are additional parameters, those items will be inserted at the position
    * It returns an array containing the deleted elements
* `array.unshift(item...)` -- like the push method, except that it shoves the items onto the front of this array instead of at the end. It returns the arrayâ€™s new length

## Function

* `function.apply(thisArg, argArray)` -- invokes a function, passing in the object that will be bound to `this` and an optional array of arguments. The `apply` method is used in the apply invocation pattern

## Number

* `number.toExponential(fractionDigits)` -- converts this number to a string in the exponential form. The optional fractionDigits parameter controls the number of decimal places. It should be between 0 and 20
    * [07_methods/number_to_exp_example.js](the_good_parts_code/07_methods/number_to_exp_example.js)
* `number.toFixed(fractionDigits)` -- converts this number to a string in the decimal form. The optional fractionDigits parameter controls the number of decimal places. It should be between 0 and 20 (default is 0)
* `number.toPrecision(precision)` -- converts this number to a string in the decimal form. The optional precision parameter controls the number of digits of precision. It should be between 1 and 21
* `number.toString(radix)` -- converts this number to a string. The optional radix parameter controls radix, or base. It should be between 2 and 36 (default radix is base 10)

## Object
